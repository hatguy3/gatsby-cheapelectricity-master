In addition to the purchase price for electricity at Nord Pool, the surcharge affects your total price for electricity trading. The surcharge covers various costs for the electricity company, including:

*   Administration and purchase of electricity certificates.
*   Fees to Svenska kraftnät and Nord Pool.
*   Balance power.
*   Any purchases of guarantees of origin.
*   The electricity company's mark-up in öre per kWh.

In addition to the surcharge, a fixed monthly fee is usually charged if you want a paper invoice.

Tip: It is important to carefully compare the mark-up between different electricity companies and make sure it includes the cost of electricity certificates.
