Your total electricity price is based on the average purchase price of Nord Pool over the last three months (April - June 2023) in your electricity area. All prices and surcharges listed include VAT and electricity certificates. Please note that the purchase price does not include the volume surcharge. The volume surcharge is an additional cost based on the average spot price, as most electricity trading customers use more electricity during hours when the price is higher. If you have an hourly metered electricity contract, you can influence the size of the volume surcharge by consuming electricity during cheaper hours. The calculated electricity price is a comparison price and your future electricity price will be affected by future spot prices, your electricity area and any volume surcharge. The annual fee applies only to the first year and may be subject to discounts.
