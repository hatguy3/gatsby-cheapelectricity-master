Network fees and energy tax apply.
==================================

In addition to the cost of electricity trading that compensates power producers for their electricity production, a network fee is added to your local network owner. The network fee compensates the network owner for your use of the electricity grid to transport the electricity from power producers to your electrical panel.

Since Sweden's electricity grid is owned by multiple actors through a regulated monopoly, you cannot choose whom to pay the network fee to.

In Sweden, most electricity consumers also have to pay an energy tax, which as of January 1, 2023, is 49 öre/kWh including VAT. For those with reduced energy tax, such as residents of Norrbotten County, Västerbotten County, and Jämtland County, the energy tax is 37 öre/kWh including VAT.

Also, keep in mind that individuals must pay value-added tax (25%) on electricity trading, network fees, and energy tax. Therefore, the normal total electricity price for 1 kWh for most individuals is approximately 1.5 – 3 SEK including VAT.
